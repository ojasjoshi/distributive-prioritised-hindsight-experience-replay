## Citing
If you use `keras-rl` in your research, you can cite it as follows:
```bibtex
@misc{plappert2016kerasrl,
    author = {Matthias Plappert},
    title = {keras-rl},
    year = {2016},
    publisher = {GitHub},
    journal = {GitHub repository},
    howpublished = {\url{https://github.com/keras-rl/keras-rl}},
}
```


## Acknowledgments
The foundation for this library was developed during my work at the [High Performance Humanoid Technologies (HÂ²T)](https://h2t.anthropomatik.kit.edu/) lab at the [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT)](https://kit.edu).
It has since been adapted to become a general-purpose library.

## Todos
- Documentation: Work on the documentation has begun but not everything is documented in code yet. Additionally, it would be super nice to have guides for each agents that describe the basic ideas behind it.
- TRPO, priority-based memory, A3C, async DQN, ...
